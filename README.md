# Glassdoor Webscrapper

This is a glassdoor scrapper that takes a user inputted job description, location, and preferred amount of jobs and returns back:
- Company Name
- Job Title
- Location
- Pay
- Job Post Age
- Rating
- Employees
- Company Age
- Company Type
- Industry
- Sector
- Revenue
- Description
It will convert and then return these data points into a Pandas DataFrame. 

## Motivation

I previously created a webscrapper using beautifulsoup4 and several other modules however, I felt like it was prety subpar. This time around I tried something that would not only be harder to make but more useful. As I am currently in the search for jobs, I felt like this program was applicable to my search as well. 

## Tech/framework used
